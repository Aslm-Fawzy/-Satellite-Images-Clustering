# Satellite Images Clustering using FC Means
Human eye can notice the major interest object of a picture and ignore others but machine canâ€™t.So we propose a new method of satellite images based on fuzzy c-means clustering (FCM) to extract an object or cloud. For example imagine a cloud that hide the main features of the image our method extracts the cloud from the satellite image clearly just like a weather expert.
